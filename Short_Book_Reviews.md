Here you can find short reviews of technical books 
that I have finished. I often find myself reading 
only the chapters I need at a given time, 
so I'll be adding reviews of these books 
after exploring them enough to form an opinion.

**RISC-V Assembly Language Programming using ESP32-C3 and QEMU**  
*by Warren Gay*

It explains very well how to set up an environment for 32-bit 
and 64-bit RISC-V along with debugging via gdb. It provides 
all the context and fine details about standardization and 
instructions you need, so you're never left wondering, 
but it can be hard to understand everything the first time.

In this book, you write assembly in subroutines that are called 
from within C, so you're also getting taught about C calling conventions, 
which is yet another nice skill to have. 
There's also a chapter on inline assembly.

It's well rounded with chapters covering other important things, 
such as portability and determining support at runtime.

It doesn't really try to teach you thinking in assembly, examples are 
nice, but the text descriptions can be hard to follow, 
simply because you have only generic register names 
in contrast to high-level languages with named variables. 
This is not a problem if you're willing to do it by yourself, 
after a while, working with assembly gets a bit more natural.
