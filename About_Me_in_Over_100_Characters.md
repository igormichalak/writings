When I accidentally started my professional career in web development 
in early 2022, at the age of 17, what I really wanted to do was 
to get into cybersecurity after getting a few certificatesâ€”or, 
with a bit of luck, create video games. I kept programming in my free time, 
and my experience with the sorry state of the frontend industry 
eventually led me into learning Go and writing more things from scratch, 
with no external dependencies, and focusing on self-hosting.

A big turning point happened after encountering Sine Lab's 
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37iSPAA_RJo) 
on PIC microcontrollers. I ordered one, 
along with a debugger/programmer for it. 
I already had some experience with electronics and computers, 
so I went with assembly instead of C, and it all went pretty well.

I ended up exploring more microcontrollers, 
computer and instruction set architectures, 
even GPUs and 3D graphics, and so much more.

Currently, my main interest is in FPGAs and computing platform design, 
with all its components, such as superscalar processors, standardized ISAs, 
programming language and compiler design.

Besides pure interest, I also just like the creative process, as in art, 
I view it all as real art. And I also love all other forms of it.

I admire hardware and software that are both efficient, well-documented, 
and fun to use, but it seems like we don't make them that way anymore...
