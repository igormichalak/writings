When I accidentally started my professional career in web development 
in early 2022, at the age of 17, what I really wanted to do was 
to get into cybersecurity after getting a few certificates---or, 
with a bit of luck, create video games. But I kept programming in my free time.

Experience with NPM and many broken or incompatible dependencies 
and the general slowness of tooling made me want to learn something different. 
This led me into learning Go and writing more things from scratch, 
with no external dependencies, which also required gaining more knowledge about 
Linux, HTTP and self-hosting.

A big turning point came after encountering Sine Lab's 
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37iSPAA_RJo) 
on PIC microcontrollers. I ordered one, along with 
a debugger/programmer for it. I already had some experience 
with electronics and computers, so I pretty much knew what to do, 
but there were still many confusing concepts for me, 
especially related to memory organization. 
I went with assembly instead of C, it wasn't hard, just somewhat cumbersome, 
but I enjoyed it anyway, programming felt like solving puzzles.

I ended up exploring more microcontrollers, and I started learning about 
how they work and the instruction set architectures. 
This sparked my interest in parallel computing, having previously enjoyed 3D graphics, 
I got drawn into GPU concepts and everything related.

My main interests haven't changed much since then, 
I'm learning more about FPGAs and computing platform design, 
with all its components, such as superscalar processors, standardized ISAs, 
programming language and compiler design.

I really like art, all sorts of it, and I believe that these fields can be a part 
of it too, so I treat them as such. And it goes beyond pure interest, 
I enjoy this creative process of making great things from simple concepts.

I prefer simplicity and efficiency in hardware and software, I also like when 
they are documented well and fun to use. But it seems like we don't make 
them that way anymore... at least I have what to do!
